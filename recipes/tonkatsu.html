        <p>Tonkatsu is a deep fried pork cutlet that is popular in Japan. It is usually cut about 3/4 inch thick and tenderized before being breaded with panko and deep fried. It is often served with a side of chopped cabbage and Bulldog sauce. There are even thick pork cutlet vertions as well, and those made with ham. Goes well with lager beer!</p>
